What is ICRmax?
==================================
ICRmax is a computational pipeline designed for the cost-effective identification of a minimal set of tumor-specific interchromosomal rearrangements (ICRs) for clinical application. 

How ICRmax works
==================================
ICRmax was developed with a set of strict filters for repetitive regions of the genome and inter-tumor comparison to eliminate false positive events. The pipeline is able to remove most cases of non-somatic events without the need for sequencing the matched normal genome for each sample.

Benefits
==================================
The cost reduction resulting from this approach creates an opportunity to implement this analysis in the clinical setting, mainly for detection of personalized biomarkers that can be used in the management of solid tumors.

Requirements
==================================
All the steps necessary for the ICRmax pipeline can be performed using Bedtools and Linux/Unix grep/sed/AWK commands. For SOLiD reads we also recommend the BLAT realignment and filtering step.

To install Bedtools see bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
To install BLAT see users.soe.ucsc.edu/~kent/src/

File formats
==================================
ICRmax starts from mate-pair whole genome sequence alignment data in BED format, allowing users to submit their sequencing results through the mapping algorithm of choice. 

To transform paired bam files into bedpe use:
$ bedtools bamtobed â€“bedpe <input.bam>

Example input:
$1 == read1_chromosome 
$2 == read1_start_position 
$3 == read1_end_position 
$4 == read2_chromosome 
$5 == read2_start_position 
$6 == read2_end_position 
$7 == matepair_id
$8 == qual
$9 == read1_strand 
$10 == read2_strand

Overview 
==================================
To run ICRmax in a Linux/Unix environment, simply follow the step-by-step command line after mapping the reads to the reference genome and downloading the necessary files. The pipeline is summarized in the figure below:
